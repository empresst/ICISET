# ICISET
## created a hybrid model with the combination of BiLSTM, BiGRU, TCN and XGBRegressor. Tested it on 8-10 datasets. Its faster and more accurate than isolated models and some hybrid models like cnngru and grufcn.
## preprocessed the datasets and then trained and tested these. 
## used MAE and RMSE for calculating error rate and plotted to visualize the difference on those datasets
